# Introduction
The aim of this project is to reveal the current patterns in the data by showing the historical data of London bike shares with visualization tools -Tableau.

# Approach
* After download and read the dataset using Kaggle API, I performed a number of steps for data cleaning and manipulation such as finding missing values, correct the data types, mapping the weather and season codes to the corresponding weather and season values.
* Then I exported the clean data into an Excel file called london_bikes.xlsx.
* Finally, with the use of Tableau, I made a real-time visualisation composed of 5 parts:
1. Total number of Bike Rides in Lodon between certain period of time.
2. A graph showing a moving average period of time with 3 filters.
3. A heat map between Windspeed and Temperature.
4. Chart showing number of bikes under different weather.
5. Chart showing number of bikes at different times of the day.
* Part 4 and 5 are displayed in the tooltip.
* The graph is real-time, meaning different values would be presented based on the time selected in the graph in Part 2.

# Conclusion
* More insights could be drawn with more different visualisations.
